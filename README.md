# Business-of-Movie-Rental-Stores
In this project many advanced queries were written on a database designed to resemble a realworld database system - Sakila Sample Database. The Sakila sample database is designed to represent a DVD rental store. The Sakila sample database still borrows film and actor names from the Dell sample database.

This project can be considered as a typical retail-related business case, because it has the main metrics you can find in any retailer’s real database, such Walmart, Shoppers, Loblaws, Amazon… 

Key Metrics: 
* Production information (in this project, it is the film) 
*  Sales information 
*  Inventory information
*  Customer behavior information
