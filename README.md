# Business-of-Movie-Rental-Stores
In this project many advanced queries were written on a database designed to resemble a realworld database system - Sakila Sample Database. The Sakila sample database is designed to represent a DVD rental store. The Sakila sample database still borrows film and actor names from the Dell sample database.

This project is a typical retail-related business case, because it has the main metrics that can be found in any retailer’s real database, such as Walmart, Shoppers, Loblaws, Amazon… 

Key Metrics: 
* Production information (in this project, it is the film) 
*  Sales information 
*  Inventory information
*  Customer behavior information

SQL queries were written to manage a chain of movie rental stores, such as:
* Track the inventory level and determine whether the rental can happen 
* Manage customer information and identify loyalty customers
* Monitor customers’ owing balance and find overdue DVDs
